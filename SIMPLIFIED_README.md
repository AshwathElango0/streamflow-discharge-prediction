# Simplified Burst Imputation Pipeline

This is a streamlined version of the burst imputation pipeline that maintains all core functionality while being much easier to understand and modify.

## Overview

The simplified code focuses on the **full model** with both spatial and temporal features, using the burst pipeline with iterative, segment-wise imputation. All redundant code has been removed while preserving the exact same logic and functionality.

## File Structure

### Core Files

1. **`simplified_main.py`** - Main entry point demonstrating the complete pipeline
2. **`simplified_burst_pipeline.py`** - Streamlined burst imputation pipeline
3. **`simplified_evaluation.py`** - Simplified evaluation on artificial gaps
4. **`simplified_utils.py`** - Essential utility functions
5. **`simplified_model_config.py`** - Model configuration (full model only)

### Key Improvements

- **Consolidated Logic**: Repetitive training and imputation code has been consolidated into reusable methods
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The `BurstImputer` class encapsulates all pipeline logic
- **Simplified Evaluation**: Single function handles both contiguous and single-point gap evaluation
- **Cleaner Utils**: Only essential functions remain, with clear documentation
- **Focused Model Config**: Only the full model configuration is included

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from simplified_main import main
main()  # Runs complete pipeline with evaluation
```

### Custom Usage

```python
from simplified_burst_pipeline import run_rolling_imputation_pipeline
from simplified_evaluation import evaluate_burst_pipeline

# Run imputation
imputed_data = run_rolling_imputation_pipeline(
    discharge_path='discharge_data_cleaned.csv',
    lat_long_path='lat_long_discharge.csv',
    contrib_path='mahanadi_contribs.csv',
    initial_train_window_size=5,
    imputation_chunk_size_years=5,
    overall_min_year=1970,
    overall_max_year=2010,
    min_completeness_percent_train=70.0,
    output_dir='results'
)

# Run evaluation
results = evaluate_burst_pipeline(
    gap_lengths_contiguous=[7, 14, 30, 60, 180],
    gap_lengths_single_point=[30, 60, 90, 180],
    output_dir='evaluation_results'
)
```

## Core Components

### 1. BurstImputer Class

The `BurstImputer` class encapsulates all pipeline logic:

- **`find_best_training_period()`**: Finds optimal training period with highest completeness
- **`prepare_training_data()`**: Prepares training data with simulated missingness
- **`train_model()`**: Trains models with caching
- **`impute_chunk()`**: Imputes data chunks using trained models
- **`run_pipeline()`**: Executes the complete burst imputation pipeline

### 2. Model Configuration

The simplified model configuration focuses on two main models:

- **Full Model**: Uses both spatial (distance + connectivity) and temporal features
- **No Contributor Model**: Uses spatial distance and temporal features, but no connectivity

### 3. Evaluation System

The evaluation system tests the pipeline on artificial gaps:

- **Contiguous Gaps**: Continuous missing data segments
- **Single Point Gaps**: Random missing data points
- **Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, R2, and NSE

## Key Features Preserved

✅ **Full Model Logic**: Both spatial and temporal features are used exactly as before  
✅ **Burst Pipeline**: Iterative, segment-wise imputation with rolling training windows  
✅ **Model Caching**: Trained models are cached to avoid retraining  
✅ **Gap Evaluation**: Both contiguous and single-point gap evaluation  
✅ **Data Preprocessing**: All data loading and preprocessing logic preserved  
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout the pipeline  

## Simplifications Made

- **Removed Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate code across multiple files
- **Consolidated Functions**: Combined similar functions into single, well-documented methods
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Replaced procedural code with clean class structure
- **Focused Scope**: Removed unused model configurations and evaluation methods
- **Clear Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings and comments

## Dependencies

The simplified code uses the same dependencies as the original:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `geopy`
- `scikit-learn` (for MissForest)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)

## Migration from Original Code

To migrate from the original code:

1. Replace `run_all_evaluations.py` with `simplified_main.py`
2. Replace `burst_pipeline.py` with `simplified_burst_pipeline.py`
3. Replace `utils.py` with `simplified_utils.py`
4. Replace `model_configurations.py` with `simplified_model_config.py`
5. Use `simplified_evaluation.py` for evaluation

The API is designed to be backward compatible where possible.

## Performance

The simplified code maintains the same performance characteristics as the original:

- **Memory Usage**: Same memory footprint
- **Speed**: Same execution time (with potential slight improvements due to reduced overhead)
- **Accuracy**: Identical results due to preserved logic

## Future Modifications

The simplified structure makes it easy to:

- **Add New Models**: Extend the `BurstImputer` class with new model types
- **Modify Evaluation**: Add new gap types or metrics in `simplified_evaluation.py`
- **Customize Features**: Modify temporal or spatial feature creation in `simplified_utils.py`
- **Adjust Pipeline**: Modify the bursting logic in the `run_pipeline()` method
